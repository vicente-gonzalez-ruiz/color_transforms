\section{The $\text{YCrCb}$ color domain}
$\text{YCrCb}$ is a \emph{luma}-based
(luminance-based\footnote{Luminance can be considered as the intensity
part of a viual stimuli.} color domain. This domain rely on the idea
of separating the luminance coefficients (Y) from two \emph{chroma}
coefficients (red and blue in the case of $\text{YCrCb}$). After using
the transform, most of the energy will be concentrated in the luma
($\text{Y}$) subband.

The $\text{YCrCb}$ color model can be considered the digital version
of the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV}{$\text{YUV}$ (analog)
  color model}, and in some way can be used to maintain the
compatibility with legacy black and white systems is maintained while
at the same time the bandwidth of the signal can be optimized by using
diï¬€erent transmission bandwidths for the brightness and the chroma
components.\footnote{Notice, however, that in the digital world
bandwidth savings are equivalent to reduce the sampling
rate.}~\cite{burger2016digital}

\section{The $\text{RGB} \Leftrightarrow \text{YCrCb}$ transform}
%{{{ 

To convert a (color) pixel from the $\text{RGB}$ domain into the
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YCbCr}{$\text{YCrCb}$} color
domain, we use the $\text{RGB/YCrCb}$ (analysis)
transform~\cite{malvar2008lifting}
%Eq.~\ref{eq:YCrCb}
%\href{https://docs.opencv.org/3.4/de/d25/imgproc_color_conversions.html}{can
%  be also written as}
\begin{equation}
  \begin{array}{lcl}
    \text{Y}  & = & 0.299\text{R} + 0.587\text{G} + 0.114\text{B} \\
    \text{Cr} & = & 0.713(\text{R} - \text{Y}) + \delta \\
    \text{Cb} & = & 0.564(\text{B} - \text{Y}) + \delta,
  \end{array}
  \label{eq:alternative_YCrCb}
\end{equation}
where,
\begin{equation}
  \delta = \left\{
  \begin{array}{ll}
    128 & \text{for 8 bits (unsigned) images},\\
    32768 & \text{for 16 bits (unsigned) images},\\
    0.5 & \text{for floating point (}[0,1]\text{) images}
  \end{array}
  \right.
\end{equation}
is used to avoid negative coefficients. As it can be seen, $\text{Cr}$
and $\text{Cb}$ are scaled versions of $\text{R} - \text{Y}$ and
$\text{B} - \text{Y}$, so $\text{Cr}$ and $\text{Cb}$ can be
interpreted as measures of how much red and blue content in a pixel
differs from luma, respectively. Notice also that for a gray pixel,
$\text{R}=\text{G}=\text{B}=\text{Y}$, and so
$\text{Cr}=\text{Cb}=0$~\cite{malvar2008lifting}.

As it can be seen, considering that the $\text{RGB}$ values ranges
between $0$ and $255$ (and rounding to the nearest integer),
$0\le\text{Y}\le 255$, $0\le\text{Cr}\le 255$ and
$0\le\text{Cb}\le 255$, and therefore, the number of bits that are
necessary to represent each $\text{YCrCb}$ component is 8 (although we
must use floating point arithmetic to perform the transform).

Finally, notice that the $\text{YCrCb}$ transform is not orthogonal
because the analysis filters are not independent. This can be seen in
the Eq.~\ref{eq:alternative_YCrCb}, where the $\text{Cr}$ coefficients
depend on the coefficients of $\text{Y}$, and therefore, there is a
dependency between both
\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basis_(linear_algebra)}{basis},
and something similar happens for the $\text{Cb}$ subband. This can
be also easely checked: $$0.299*0.5 + 0.587*(-0.4187) +
0.114*(-0.0813) = -0.1055451 \neq 0,$$ $$0.299*(-0.1687) +
0.587*(-0.3313) + 0.114*0.5 = -0.1879144 \neq
0,~\mathrm{and}$$ $$0.5*(-0.1687) + (-0.4187)*(-0.3313 ) +
(-0.0813)*0.5 = 0.01371531 \neq 0.$$
